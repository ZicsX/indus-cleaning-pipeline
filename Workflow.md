### 1. **Architecture Components**

1. **Amazon S3**:
   - `Input` Bucket: Where new text files are uploaded.
   - `Cleaned` Bucket (or same bucket with a different prefix): Where cleaned text files are stored.

2. **AWS Lambda**:
   - `FileProcessorLambda`: Triggered when a new file is uploaded to the `Input` bucket, initiates the Step Functions execution.
   - `TextCleanerLambda`: Cleans the text.

3. **AWS Step Functions**:
   - Orchestrates the workflow of downloading the file from S3, cleaning the text, and uploading the cleaned text back to S3.

4. **Amazon CloudWatch**:
   - Monitors the Lambda functions and Step Functions for any errors, logs the processing details.

5. **Amazon SNS (Optional)**:
   - Sends notifications in case of any failures or issues during processing.

### 2. **Workflow**

1. **File Upload**:
   - A user uploads a new text file to the `Input` folder in the S3 bucket.

2. **Trigger Lambda**:
   - The upload event triggers the `FileProcessorLambda`. This Lambda function initiates the Step Functions execution and passes the S3 file path as input.

3. **Step Functions Execution**:
   - **State 1 (Get File)**: The workflow starts by downloading the file content from the `Input` bucket.
   - **State 2 (Clean Text)**: The content is passed to the `TextCleanerLambda`, which cleans the text and returns the cleaned content.
   - **State 3 (Save Cleaned File)**: The cleaned text is saved to the `Cleaned` bucket, maintaining the same folder structure or path.

4. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - All Lambda function executions, as well as Step Functions execution, are logged in CloudWatch.
   - Any errors or failures can be monitored in CloudWatch. Optionally, in the case of a failure, a notification can be sent using Amazon SNS.

5. **Completion**:
   - Once the Step Functions execution completes, the cleaned file is available in the `Cleaned` bucket, and the original remains in the `Input` folder.

### 3. **Advantages**

1. **Scalability**: AWS Lambda can handle a large number of files concurrently, allowing for high scalability.
2. **Serverless**: No need to manage any infrastructure.
3. **Robustness**: AWS Step Functions ensures that each step is completed successfully. In the case of transient failures, it can automatically retry the failed step.
4. **Maintainability**: The serverless architecture is easy to maintain and modify. If the cleaning process needs to change, only the `TextCleanerLambda` function needs to be updated.

### 4. **Considerations**

1. **Lambda Execution Time**: AWS Lambda has a maximum execution time (15 minutes as of my last update). Ensure that the text cleaning process completes within this timeframe for each file.
2. **Step Functions Cost**: AWS Step Functions has associated costs per state transition. While it's generally inexpensive, it's something to keep in mind with a large number of files.
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure that the Step Functions state machine has proper error handling and retry mechanisms for transient failures.

### 5. **Deployment**

1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Consider using AWS CloudFormation or the AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) to define and deploy the architecture. This makes the setup reproducible and version-controlled.

This architecture provides a robust, scalable, and efficient way to process new text files added to the `Input` folder, clean them, and maintain the same folder structure in the `Cleaned` bucket.
